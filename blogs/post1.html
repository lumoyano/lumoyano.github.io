            <h1>Blockchain in a nutshell</h1>
            <h4 style="text-align: right; font-style: italic;">October 10th, 2023</h4>
        </div>
        <hr><br>
        <p>I recently came to what I believe is the end (for now) of a project I've been working on for somewhere around 4-5 
            months. Spiro Buzharovski's book "Introducing Blockchain with Java" caught my eye last summer at my local library, 
            so I made sure to come back and snatch it. What followed was very little reading and significant amounts of 
            coding with my own hands. It was perfect! <br>
            The final product is thus: </p><br>   

        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>
            First, we design the Model for everything, consisting of the Block, Transaction, and Wallet classes. Two 
            major problems were made known as I made my slow progress through the respective chapter of this part: 
        <li>
            1 Although mostly written in vanilla Java, I ran for the first time into the Sun.Security package, which became 
            my constant companion and I'll explain more about it later.</li> <br>
        <li>
            2 Following along the book felt a lot like my very poor intro to CS classes once again, where instead of following 
            a method of incrementing existing, working code, to make it more complete, we instead just started on point A and 
            pushed through all the way to point Z. In other words, left and right were methods and classes called which did not 
            at the moment exist, and wouldn't exist for the dozens of hours to come before I made my way to their respective 
            chapters. Anyone coding outside of Notepad can sympathize with how the developer's brain reacts to so much red on 
            one single screen.</li></p><br>

        <h3>SQLite database</h3>
        <p>
            Oh the blessing of finally having a use for SQL. I had sought projects for a long time that would push me to learn 
            it, but this one actually achieved it. SQLite was a nice and light (see what I did there?) approach because of the 
            interface and "drag and drop" aspect of it. Seeing the SQL output as I edited the table was marvelous, and with no 
            crash course at all, I was typing tables into existence just like that. </p>
            <img src="/media/pictures/blogs/post1/SQLpicture.png">
        <p>
            In the end, we create a blockchain.db file, which holds the BlockChain and Transactions tables. For the sake of 
            security, the Wallet.db object was left as a standalone table. Using JDBC for my first time, I later came to add 
            the path to those into my program, as well as safety measures to CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wherever needed, ensuring 
            that no Exception is thrown and however silly I may be, there will always be the right path to save our valuable 
            virtual money.</p> <br>

        <h3>JavaFX - GUI</h3>
        <p>
            I don't like creating GUIs in Java. It's one of my biggest reasons to move away from it. With this, I ran into the 
            problem that when you plainly import the JavaFX package into your program, it is not found. A little bit of digging 
            and we discover that it was removed from the JDK in 2018. With the JDK 11 being the first usable version of it these 
            days, that wasn't much help. </p>
        <p>
            I found that Gluon made it open source and with a few downloads, a visit to project structure settings, and some 
            familiarity with using libs after implementing SQLite, I was ready to use it. The next step was to download SceneBuilder, 
            a drag-and-drop interface to create GUIs using specifically JavaFX. It had somewhat of a learning curve, but considering 
            the incredibly simple design we are making that was no problem at all. All that's left is to create Controller 
            respectives with more promises of methods to come, ignore some red flags, and pray for the best to come.</p>

        <h3>Multithreading and Service Layer</h3>
        <p>
            Here we made a few threads that ran constantly in the background. My IDE wasn't happy with possible "busy-waiting" 
            threads, but I am new to it and didn't dare experiment. We establish some local ports as a communication since going
            online isn't very safe, and call it a day. This will prove not very efficient though, since running the program 
            effectively means you have to instantiate the entire repository and update ports and paths in order to create peers 
            that communicate back to you.</p>
        <p>
            The final step in the book is the nightmare-bringing service layer. I want to say that this is some of the most 
            confusing, extensive code I've written. The WalletData class is a singleton one. All there is to it is the single 
            field of Wallet, and the methods to return an instance of it. This is important because that way, our machine can 
            only handle one wallet at a time. Because throughout the program we use instances of the wallet, it means only one 
            gets created, and the rest of the time is spent calling back to it, wherever it may be stored. </p>
        <p>
            Most importantly though, this class established what would later be the solution to all of my fears. You see, sun.security used an 
            object called DSAPublicKeyImpl. A visit to chatGPT would clarify that this takes in a byte array and returns the 
            PublicKey for it. How to implement that on regular Java remained a mystery to me and the AI gods apparently, until we 
            ran into the odd handling of public keys on the WalletData class. Here we learn that a KeyFactory object can be created 
            using DSA, familiar to me now since SHA256withDSA has been a recurring statement within most classes. We learn that a 
            public key uses an X509EncodedKeySpec object, while the public seems to use a PKCS8EncodedKeySpec. We also see on those 
            lines that both are valid arguments to the keyFactory methods generatePublic/generatePrivate. </p>
        <span style="font-size: 14px; font-style: italic; text-align: justify;">
            Side note. IntelliJ makes amazing IDEs, and their in-text annotations were crucial for me to reverse engineer this 
            implementation. Because it can point out in real time what types are needed and what types I am passing, I was able 
            to sort of guess around until I ran into the right structure/syntax to use in this.</span>
        <p>
            Back to our key dilemma. Since the validation process uses public keys, all instances to be fixed only needed the 
            X509 Encoded Key object in order to work. The fixed final code looks the following:</p>
            <img src="/media/pictures/blogs/post1/DSAsample.png">
        <p>
            First, we need the KeyFactory object, which is created by specifying the Algorithm that will be used to deserialize 
            our byte array into an actual key. With that ready and on the side we create the X509EncodedKeySpec object. This 
            will usually hold a bite array, which is our "address" for Wallet objects, and "from" for Transactions. As the name 
            denotes, this is an encoded version of the key, missing only the final step of decoding. One quick call to our keyFactory, 
            which knows we are handling everything DSA, and we can pass the final PublicKey object into our signing method, which 
            in the reference is used to stamp the sender onto the current Block. Breaking down the process into three different lines 
            makes it much more digestible, especially since some statements are quite long at this point. </p>
        <p>The rest of the service layer is too extensive to cover in a blog post and too complicated for me to go in depth. This 
            isn't an educational page, but I'll list some good resources later.</p><br>

        <h3>Build and debugging</h3>
        <p>
            Remember the issue with invoking methods that haven't been written yet? Well, it makes for incredible amounts of 
            spelling errors, not to mention that I was writing this from a book, and the editor seems to forget that english 
            rules don't matter in coding, but consistency does. Needless to say, I spent a while rewriting chunks of code and 
            single calls, using Spiro's publicly available repo for the project as a reference. Speaking of Spiro, I was actually 
            able to contact him and found the man incredibly responsive. As of today, he asked me for my repo in order to check 
            some final issues I wasn't able to figure out on my own. He very clearly wrote the app himself, since with no 
            significant conversation he correctly guessed exactly where I missed a statement that made the program crash. Called 
            out by the pro himself, ouch! The most challenging aspect left was surprisingly the SQL queries. Since my IDE had no 
            SQL helper embedded, I made quite a few mistakes as a beginner, missing commas instead of semicolons. I felt like a 
            16-year-old in school again!</p>
        <p>
            Like I previously alluded to, I spent hours debugging this program in order not to embarrass myself again in front 
            of its author. After a very frustrating day on the debugger, I decided to skip the errors. To my surprise, and demise, 
            I had overlooked something very important. The program is very robust with its catch and exception statements, so after 
            a successful build, I spent the next few days dealing with errors that didn't actually stop the program from running, I 
            just never thought about resuming the process after running into red text called by the most often used printStackTrace 
            all throughout the scope of the project. The program had been working for a long time, but in my oversight, I ended up 
            fixing many minor mistakes I made that led to not very significant errors or bugs.</p>

        <p>I don't have an outro or conclusion to make other than all of the above text, but if you want to look into some of the 
            resources I used, here are the links to Spiro's book and an article on Medium by user Kass, who already went through 
            the trouble of putting together a nice list of free resources to dive right into the world of Blockchain. <br>
